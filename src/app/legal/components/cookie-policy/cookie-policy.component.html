      Cookies can either be session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires
      automatically when you close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires or
      you delete your cookies. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire
      after a few minutes while others may expire after multiple years. Cookies placed by the
      website you’re visiting are called “first party cookies”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strictly Necessary cookies are necessary for our website/app to function and cannot be
      switched off in our systems. They are essential in order to enable you to navigate around the
      website/app and use its features. If you remove or disable these cookies, we cannot guarantee
      that you will be able to use our website/app.
    </p>
    <p>We use the following types of cookies in our website/app:</p>
    <h4>Essential Cookies</h4>
    <p>
      We use essential cookies to make our website/app work. These cookies are strictly necessary to
      enable core functionality such as security, network management, your cookie preferences and
      accessibility. Without them you wouldn't be able to use basic services. You may disable these
      by changing your browser settings, but this may affect how the Websites function.
    </p>
    <h4>Performance and Functionality Cookies</h4>
    <p>
      These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website/app but are
      non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality like videos
      may become unavailable or you would be required to enter your login details every time you
      visit the website/app as we would not be able to remember that you had logged in previously.
    </p>
    <h4>Analytics and Customization Cookies</h4>
    <p>
      These cookies collect information that is used to help us understand how our website/app is
      being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our
      website/app for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use cookies served by Google Analytics to collect limited data directly from end-user
      browsers to enable us to better understand your use of our website/app. Further information on
      how Google collects and uses this data can be found at:&nbsp;

      .
    </p>
    <h4>Advertising Cookies</h4>
    <p>
      These cookies collect information over time about your online activity on the website/app and
      other online services to make online advertisements more relevant and effective to you. This
      is known as interest-based advertising. They also perform functions like preventing the same
      ad from continuously reappearing and ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers.
      Without cookies, it’s really hard for an advertiser to reach its audience, or to know how many
      ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
    </p>
    <h4>Third Party Cookies</h4>
    <p>
      Some cookies that have been set on our website/app are not set on a first party basis by
      TekCapsule. The Websites can be embedded with content from third parties to serve advertising.
      These third party service providers may set their own cookies on your web browser. Third party
      service providers control many of the performance and functionality, advertising, marketing
      and analytics cookies described above. We do not control the use of these third party cookies
      as cookies can only be accessed by the third party that originally set them.
    </p>
    <h4>How you can manage cookies?</h4>
    <p>
      Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their 'settings' preferences. However, if
      you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience,
      since it will no longer be personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized
      settings like login information. Browser manufacturers provide help pages relating to cookie
      management in their products.

      technologies, but this action may block our essential cookies and prevent our website from

      different controls available to you. Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete
      the cookie from your browser, you will need to do this yourself from within your browser, you
      should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
