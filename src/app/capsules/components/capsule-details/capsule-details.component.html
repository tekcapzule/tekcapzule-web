            <p>Artificial intelligence, or AI, is a rapidly growing field that has become increasingly relevant in
                todayâ€™s world. AI is the development of computer systems that are capable of performing tasks that
                typically require human intelligence, such as perception, learning, problem-solving, and
                decision-making. With the exponential growth of data and computing power, AI has become more powerful
                and more prevalent in a wide range of industries, from healthcare to finance, transportation to
                entertainment.</p>
